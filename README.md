Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding

Overview-->

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to insights delivery through dashboards and presentations. The work includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning in Python, SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL, and visualization using Power BI. Final insights are documented in a written report and a presentation created with Gamma.

The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills rather than theoretical models.

Description:
The dataset contains structured records used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance metrics relevant to the business problem.

Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python

Libraries: pandas

Database: PostgreSQL

Querying: SQL

Visualization: Power BI

Presentation: Gamma

Project Workflow

Data Loading

Loaded raw dataset into Python using pandas.

Validated schema, data types, and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and correlations.

Identified outliers, inconsistencies, and data quality issues.

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names and formats.

Created derived features where required.

SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Wrote SQL queries to answer key analytical questions.

Used joins, aggregations, filters, and window functions where applicable.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Focused on KPIs, trends, and comparisons.

Designed for clarity and stakeholder usability.

Reporting & Presentation

Summarized findings in a structured report.

Created a concise presentation using Gamma for non-technical audiences.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Category-wise and segment-wise breakdowns

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Note: Dashboard screenshots or .pbix file can be found in the /dashboard directory.

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the data.

Highlighted areas of improvement and potential risks.

Provided data-backed recommendations based on SQL and visual analysis.
